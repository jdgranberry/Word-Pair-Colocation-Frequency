# Word-Pair-Coloction-Frequency
This pair of scripts, the mapper and reducer, compute the number of times a pair of words is found within n words of each other in a given input using Python scripting and Hadoop MapReduce. This proof of concept was used to inform Dr. Paul Prueitt's Data Science Group at Texas State University about the feasibility of using such a system in the group's primary mission.
